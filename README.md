# Fluid Converter

Fluid Converter is a mobile application built with Expo, React, and TypeScript that can help users convert ounces to fluid ounces and vice versa. 

## Features
* Conversion of water ounces to fluid ounces and vice versa
* Calculation of water density based on temperature
* Simple and user-friendly UI with reactive inputs

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, clone the repository and run `npm install` to install the necessary dependencies. You can then run the app using `expo start` or `npm start`. 

## Usage

The app consists of two input fields: one for water ounces and one for fluid ounces. Users can enter a value in either field, and the app will automatically calculate and display the corresponding value in the other field. 

To ensure accurate conversions, users must also input the temperature in Fahrenheit and the density of the water they are using. The app will automatically calculate the density based on the temperature entered.
